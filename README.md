# debian-fpi
A modified version of archfi for Debian, which I called Debian Fast Post-Installer, or Debian FPI, where you can install a desktop enviroment (currently GNOME and KDE Plasma (under testing)); tools, drivers, applications and the ability to setup virtualization stuff.

## How to use
Just clone it using:
> git clone https://github.com/gfelipe099/debian-fpi

And then execute it using:
> sudo ./debian-fpi.sh

Sudo permissions are required, because it modifies system related stuff. Although, **do not use this script in your daily driver machine until it's declared stable**.
