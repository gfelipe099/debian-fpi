{"name":"debian-fpi","tagline":"The Debian Fast Post-Installer","body":"# **debian-fpi**\r\nA modified version of archfi for Debian, which I called Debian Fast Post-Installer, or Debian FPI, where you can install a desktop enviroment (currently GNOME and KDE Plasma); tools, drivers, applications, fix common issues and/or setup virtualization capabilities.\r\n\r\n**All of the packages are delivered within Debian main repository only, 'contrib' and 'non-free' repositories were removed from this open-source edition.**\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nLooking for the non-free version? Click [here](https://github.com/gfelipe099/debian-fpi/tree/nonfree)\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## **Statement before using Debian FPI**\r\nThere are a few requirements which you have to do in order to use this script correctly or to even make it work correctly (this may change in the future):\r\n\r\nYou explicitly need to:\r\n> **Use the EXT4 filesystem in order to use a swap file.**\r\n\r\n> **Not include a swap partition in your favorite or preferred partition scheme.**\r\n\r\n> **Disallow, not use or disable the root account upon the installation or the script will fail in some areas.**\r\n\r\n> **Disallow the use of non-free and contrib software.**\r\n\r\n> **Deselect everything from the tasksel part: Debian desktop enviroment, printer software and basic system utilities. The script will handle that after.**\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## **How to use**\r\nCopy and paste this command which will get you up and running:\r\n\r\n    sudo apt update -y && sudo apt install -y wget && wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gfelipe099/debian-fpi/master/debian-fpi.sh && chmod a+x debian-fpi.sh && sudo ./debian-fpi.sh\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## **Why to execute the script as sudo?**\r\nSudo permissions are required, because it modifies system settings.\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
